# Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-in-Python
This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm using Python. It serves as a hands-on exercise to strengthen understanding of string manipulation techniques. The cipher works by shifting each letter in the input text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
