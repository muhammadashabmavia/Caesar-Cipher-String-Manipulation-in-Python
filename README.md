# Caesar Cipher – String Manipulation in Python 🔐

This project is a simple yet effective implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** using Python. It’s designed to help beginners strengthen their understanding of **string manipulation**, **ASCII encoding**, and **basic algorithmic logic**.

## 📌 What You’ll Learn:
- How to encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher
- Manipulating strings with Python’s `ord()` and `chr()`
- Handling uppercase and lowercase letters
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable functions
- Conditional statements and loops

> ✅ Great for anyone learning Python and looking to build logic through hands-on coding challenges.
